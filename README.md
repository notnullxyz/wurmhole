Wurm PLAYER and SKILLS data manipulator API

### Supported Features ###

* Get all skills for a player
* Get (most) safe attributes for a player
* Update a skill for a player
* Update one or more safe attributes of a player

### What do I do ###

As this is a quick fix API solution, please check out the included INSOMNIA REST CLIENT export.
Documentation will follow, as will a proper design and refactor.
Safety checks could be improved, and should (send me a PR? ;) )

### Who do I talk to? ###
